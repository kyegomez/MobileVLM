class LDP(nn.Module):
    """
    Lightweight Downsample Projection (LDP) layer implementation in PyTorch with a depth parameter.

    The LDP layer applies a sequence of depthwise separable convolutions with GELU activation function.
    The sequence can be repeated multiple times based on the 'depth' parameter.
    The final output of the sequence is added to the original input via a pixel-wise addition.

    Parameters:
    in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input image
    out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolutions
    depth (int): Number of times the sequence of operations is repeated


    Example usage:
    ldp = LDP(in_channels=128, out_channels=128, depth=3)
    input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 128, 64, 64)  # Example input
    output = ldp(input_tensor)
